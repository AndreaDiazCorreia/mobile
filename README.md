# Mostro Mobile Client

Super early version of a mobile client for the [Mostro](https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro) P2P platform.

This project is a mobile interface that facilitates peer-to-peer bitcoin trading over the lightning network ⚡️ using nostr 🦩. The lightning network is a layer 2 scaling solution for bitcoin that enables fast and low-cost transactions.

## Prerequisites

### For the Mobile Client

- Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install): Follow the official guide for your operating system.
- Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional but recommended)

### For Mostro Daemon

- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### For Testing Environment

- Install [Polar](https://lightningpolar.com/): For simulating Lightning Network nodes

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MostroP2P/mobile.git
   cd mobile
   ```

2. Install Flutter dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Generate localization and other required files:

   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build -d
   ```

> **Note:**
> These commands generate files needed by `flutter_intl` and any other code generators. You must run them after installing dependencies and whenever you update localization files or code generation sources. If you skip this step, you may encounter missing file errors when running the app.

## Running the App

### On Emulator/Simulator

```bash
flutter run
```

### On Physical Device

Connect your device and run:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Setting up Mostro Daemon

1. Clone the Mostro repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro.git
   cd mostro
   ```

2. Set up the configuration:

   ```bash
   cp settings.tpl.toml settings.toml
   ```

   Edit `settings.toml` with your specific configurations.

3. Initialize the database:

   ```bash
   ./init_db.sh
   ```

4. Run the Mostro daemon:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

See the README.md in the mostro repository for more details.

## Setting up Polar for Testing

1. Launch Polar and create a new Lightning Network.
2. Configure at least one node (e.g., "alice").
3. Copy the necessary connection details (cert file, macaroon file) to your Mostro `settings.toml`.

## Development Workflow

1. Ensure Polar is running with your test Lightning Network.
2. Start the Mostro daemon.
3. Run the Flutter app and connect it to your local Mostro instance.
